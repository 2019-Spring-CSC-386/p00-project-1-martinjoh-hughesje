## Purpose

Our Project needs to solve the issue of getting the right ammount of sleep. We will do this by looking up appropriate information pertaining to what is the right ammount of time a person needs in order to nap, and feel fully rested. The Embedded system will then wake them up in the approprate ammount of time. The device will act as an alarm set to the right ammount of time for a comfortable, and healthy nap. 

## Initial Design Plan
*[Fritzing website](http://fritzing.org/home/ "Fritzing website" (for our diagram)*

# Outline 
- Hardware 
  - There will be a timer/clock, and device for sound connected to our Arduino divice. 
  - This will help us to deced the appropiate ammount of time on the timer, and program it so that the alarm goes off when 
    the time is out 
    
- Code 
  - Function for the timer 
  - function for button press 
  - function for the sound 
  - A function to start the timmer when the button is pressed
  - A function to start the sound when the timer runs out 
  - A function to stop the sound either when the button is pressed again, or after a certain amount of beeps 
  - Your program must follow good coding standards. 
  Primarily, I mean your code should include meaningful functions 
  and appropriate variables, and be formatted and commented well. 
  Sloppy code with no structure will be penalized

**NOTE**: Your initial design plan may not fully reflect your final product,
as projects evolve over time.

## Files
*You'll complete this section as part of Milestone 1.*
* List every file in your repository, and briefly summarize each file's purpose in a sentence.*
 
-Buzzer_code.ino : This will help us to understand how to make sounds using the Arduino. 
- Button.ino : This file will help us to understand how to use the button on Arduino
- TimeCheck.ino: this file will help us to understand exactly how to work with time on the Arduino. 

## Summary
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Provide a brief summary description of the design and implementation,
including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result
you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in
accomplishing these results, including any challenges overcome and
innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment.
This section should be no more than three paragraphs.

## Instructions
Explain how to use your product. 
This section should THOROUGHLY describe its usage (i.e., more than just "Push start").

## Errors and Constraints
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of
all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your product. 
Also, list any constraints that must exist for your product to work 
(e.g., Only works in low light situations).

## Reflection
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Write 2 - 4 paragraphs on your reactions to the final project. 
Your reflection should be thoughtful and reflective. 
It is NOT a report about WHAT you did. 
Instead, it's a look back at what you learned by doing this project.
It should be critical of shortcomings (yours, as well as the instructors/assignments) 
as well as celebratory of what was achieved.

## References
*Start this section at the beginning of the project, and update it throughout.*

## Final Self-Evaluations
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project. 
Assign points to each team member in each category, based on their contribution to the team. 
The sum of all member's points in each category cannot exceed 10. 
For example, for Coding, Partner 1 could get 7 points, and Partner 2 gets 3 points. 
You can't give both people 6 points each though, as the sum exceeds 10.

### Ideation, Brainstorming, Design:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Code creation: 

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Documentation creation:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Teamwork & Participation:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

**A Note from Scott to You**

While I expect this project to have issues, one
thing to keep in mind is HAVE FUN with it! Create a product that
expresses your personal interests. Break up the writing so itâ€™s not so burdensome.
We will have a live demo sessions at the end of the project to celebrate your accomplishments.
